# Machine-Learning-Projects


To build a Machine learning projects we need to do Dataset preparation and preprocessing. Data is the foundation for any machine learning project. The second stage of project implementation is complex and involves data collection, selection, preprocessing, and transformation. Each of these phases can be split into several steps.

Few ML projects implemented by me are as follows
1) Restaurant Rating 
  Problem Statement:
    The main goal of this project is to perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on
    the Zomato Dataset and build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help
    various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain
    features.

    Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
    Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
    learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

    Results: You have to build a solution that should able to predict the ratings of the
    restaurants listed in the dataset.


2) Wafer Fault Detection
3) Backorder prediction
